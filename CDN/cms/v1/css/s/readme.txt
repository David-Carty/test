's' stands for skins. IMportant: Yes we could and perhaps should use these skins for the cms, however the cms is evolving
and so the skins format is not 100% set in stone.  So for now the cms has its own skins in root/themes.

They are the styles utalised by all proprietory components.  If the user changes the skins
then the structual look, not the colour of the solution changes.

app.css - is designed for web applications.  Applications usually fit more on the screen than
websites.

Flat and md (material design) are designed for websites and are completely interchangable.
That is if you switch to flat from md, your site will still look perfect.

Flat-lg - This is just flat upscaled to larger base fonts and larger components.  So tabs appear bigger.  It is designed for sites that
present less information and can afford the additional real estate. For this reason if the style is changed to flat after designing
a site in flat-lg certain elements may contain too much white space or if a site is designed first in flat and switched to flat-lg
then overflow may occur. 

iOS must also conform to flat and md as android devices use md and ios and android devices must be interchangable without glitches.
