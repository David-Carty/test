There are a limited number of themes that the cms,editor, partner admin can apply.

Dark and light maybe enough, however themes will be very easy to create so light blue, grey etc
could be applied in the future.

The wireframe theme is also essential and should appear here.

's' stands for skins. Important: Yes we could and perhaps should use the skins for the cms, from root/css/s/ however the cms is evolving
and so the skins format is not 100% set in stone.  So, for now the cms has its own skins in root/themes.
