This is a json format file that stores the definition of the component that is created in the UI.
The json tree contains:

"name":
"version":
"description":
"dateCreated":
"lastEdited":
params{
    {"name": "", "default": "", "description"},
    ...}	
methods{
    {"name": "", "type", "arguements": "", "description"},
    ...}
	
This format is available to both the creator of the component and end user as the end user may wish to add a method to the component without impacting the original component as a copy of the component is made to the site's component folder.
