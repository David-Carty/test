This directory is cleared at the start of every session.
When a user starts a new session of editing, in the cms, the first time that they save a file, the original file, prior to changes, is copied here.  Subsequent saves will not overwrite this file.

If the user screws up a file in their current session they will be able to revert back to the original via a dialog in the cms.  The user will not see this directory in their filemanager tree.
